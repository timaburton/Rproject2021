# Question 1

    positive[(i+1)]<-1

During the earliest days of screening, there were a greater number of positive cases for country X than country Y. Positive cases do not show up in country Y until about 20 days after country X. Therefore, the disease started in country X.")

print("If country Y develops a vaccine, it is unlikely to work for county X because the two countries show very different markers. Each marker can cause a patient to be positive for infection, but the difference in marker prevalence indicates mutation within the disease. If country Y developed an effective vaccine, it would most likely target markers 6 and 7 because they are found in the greatest number of patients, which would not be effective for infected patients in country X where markers 1-5 are most prevalent.")
