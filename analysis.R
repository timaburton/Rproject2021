### 1.In which country (X or Y) did the disease outbreak likely begin?
############ whichever has more infections on the first day 



sum(alldata[alldata$dayofYear == "120" & alldata$country == "X", 3:12]) 
sum(alldata[alldata$dayofYear == "120" & alldata$country == "Y", 3:12])


#This the number of infected people on the first day in country X
infectedX
#This the number of infected people on the first day in country Y
infectedY
#Because more people were infected on the first day in country X, the outbreak most likely originated there

### 2. If Country Y develops a vaccine for the disease, is it likely to work for citizens of Country X?

dataX175 <- subset(alldata, dayofYear=="175" & country=="X")
dataY175 <- subset(alldata, dayofYear=="175" & country=="Y")
dfX <- data.frame (marker = 1:10, markerSum = c(sum(dataX175$marker01),sum(dataX175$marker02),sum(dataX175$marker03),sum(dataX175$marker04),sum(dataX175$marker05),sum(dataX175$marker06),sum(dataX175$marker07),sum(dataX175$marker08),sum(dataX175$marker09),sum(dataX175$marker10)))
dfY <- data.frame (marker = 1:10, markerSum = c(sum(dataY175$marker01),sum(dataY175$marker02),sum(dataY175$marker03),sum(dataY175$marker04),sum(dataY175$marker05),sum(dataY175$marker06),sum(dataY175$marker07),sum(dataY175$marker08),sum(dataY175$marker09),sum(dataY175$marker10)))


library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = dfY, aes(x=marker, y=markerSum)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

ggplot(data = dfX, aes(x=marker, y=markerSum)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

#Based on the two bar graphs on day 175, the last day of sampling, infected people in country Y displayed markers 6-10 at an extemely high rate and markers 1-5 at a very low rate. Country X was the opposite. If Country Y developed a vaccine, it is very unlikely to work for Country X since infected people in each of the two countries display different markers for the disease.
